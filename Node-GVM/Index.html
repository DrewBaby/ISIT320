            <article>
                <p>
                    For our integrated development environment, we chose to use Visual Studio 2019 as the defacto tool.
                    Main reason for this selection is as follow:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will develop an ASP.NET Core 3.0 web based application and Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 comes
                        fully ready to support this effort </li>
                    <li>Visual Studio 2019 is a full-featured integrated development environment</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio has all the features that a developer might need during his application
                        development process</li>
                    <li>Azure Cloud integrations</li>
                    <li>Test Development Integrations</li>
                    <li>Easy to implement Debugging Tools and Break Points</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Platform</h2>
                <p>For the platform, we chose to develop on Windows platform to support ease and simplifcation of the
                    team to pickup and manage. Moving away from Microsoft Windows and Visual Studio 019 may have led to
                    issues pertaining to learning curve for team members participating in the project. The KISS
                    principle applies here for this project. </p>
                <h2>External Dependencies</h2>
                <p>To acheive our goal, we need the ability to leverage external services to provide the rich content to
                    power bring life to the site. </p>
                <h3>IGDB</h3>
                <p> IGDB.com is a video game online data source providing interface for external consumers to access
                    data of all games and details for each game stored in a central location
                </p>
                <p>Through IGDB API, there are many endpoints used to return back specific data used supporting what is
                    neede such as company name, game characters, expansion pack detail, game summary, online video,
                    cover detail, game images, and much more.

                </p>
                <h3>Google Identity</h3>
                <p>We wanted to add a visibly trusted and secure Sign In With Google button to your app. This will
                    provide the ability to authenticate and identify members and tear down the anonymous behaviour of
                    the internet.</p>
                <p>Users sign-in to a Google Account once, without re-entering username or password when visiting your
                    site. On return visits sign users in automatically or with one click.</p>
                <p>Through the Google's OAuth 2.0 APIs, We were able to conform to the OpenID Connect specificatione
                    used for authentication and authorization.
                    <br> For further detail, please visit the following Google Identity site <a

                            methods and events which can be utilized to control and manipulate the slider/carousel and
